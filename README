DAMSON stands for Data Markup in JSON.

It's a highly flexible template language where JSON documents produce
text output.

At it's core is a registry of handler functions that process JSON
objects.  Every JSON object in a DAMSON document should have a 'type'
value corresponding to an entry in the DAMSON registry.

A multi-lingual HelloWorld example:

	var DAMSON = require('./damson')

	var siteLanguage = 'EN';

	function renderText(node) {
		return node[siteLanguage];
	}

	DAMSON.register('text', renderText);

	DAMSON.render({type:'text', EN: 'Hello World', FR: 'Bonjour'});

Nodes that do not have a type, or do not have any handlers for that
type, will produce no output.

If multiple handlers are registered for the same type, they all run,
in the order they were registered, and their output is concatentated.

Simple values found in a DAMSON document (strings, booleans, numbers)
are simply concatenated.

Arrays in a DAMSON document have each member rendered and
concatenated.
